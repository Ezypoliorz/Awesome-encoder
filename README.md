# Awesome-encoder
An great text encoder using an affine function 

Awesome ancoder is a python program to encode and decode crypted messages.
It uses an affine function (a*x+b) :
- x = The index in the alphabet of each letter of the original message
- a = 3 (or any number prime with 26)
- b = the length of each word
This means that every word of the message is encrypted differently !
